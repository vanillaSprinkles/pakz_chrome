pakz_chrome!

my re-packed *.pak files for various google chrome and/or srware iron (or other?) programs

included are the raw file-id's and pak files .. both my own edits and stock versions


Iron/Chrome for Win uses dll's, ignoring at least the "chrome.pak" file.
Doubtful I will bustout the time and energy for the dll building; be easier to recompile the entire source.


2014 update:
background-theme-patching now resides within the "resources.pak" file (at least in linux)
